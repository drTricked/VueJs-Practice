# weather-app

Followed a tutorial video on creating a weather app. Was hoping it taught me more about the templates and different components but it did not. Start of project was very finicky as there was an issue with installing and creating using the cli. 

## Project setup
```
npm install
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development
```
npm run serve
```

### Compiles and minifies for production
```
npm run build
```

### Lints and fixes files
```
npm run lint
```

### Customize configuration
See [Configuration Reference](https://cli.vuejs.org/config/).
