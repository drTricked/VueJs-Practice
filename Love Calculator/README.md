I saw this API and thought it was funny. Reminds me of the similar ones they use to have on early facebook that I would see on my timeline as a kid in elementary. Interestingly the compatibility goes up the more characters you put in the names, and more common characters.

Just practicing using API calls and some basic html. Using fetch GET, and v-model.

For some reason we are getting 500 internal server error. Not sure what I can do about that.

UPDATE: found the error was with the fetch call
