# Basic Calculator

I am doing my first project from scratch no tutorial. I am making a basic calculator.

Plan:

Build UI - make the grid with CSS GRID
Set methods for each button
Add some button animations

Update: some bugs with the logic
Update: fixed them, changed the overall logic
Practiced CSS Grid, @click
