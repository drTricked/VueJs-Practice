# VueJs-Practice

Here is some practice programs I wrote to learn VueJs.

Update: 19 days left till the interview, seen some interesting projects that used vue js. The framework seems relatively simple and intuitive.

Update: I added the 16 days but branching was weird? Anyways 16 days left, will want to start working on bigger projects by next week.

Update: 8 days, have done some small projects so far.
